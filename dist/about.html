                <p>After finishing High School i continued studies where slowly i enter the world of graphics and graphic design
                    at the Technical College in Novi Sad, Department of Graphic Engineering.
                    <br> At that period, i was a regular web user as most people. I become more interested in web while i was
                    working in the studio.
                    <br> Then i decided to enroll in Krojaceva school for web designers, so i was able to improve my knowledge
                    and skills and i satisfied my passion for creativity too. I do each project seriously and professionally,
                    choosing the best solutions for your ideas, suggestions and needs.
